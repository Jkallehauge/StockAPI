# StockAPI
This set of scripts is mainly for testing Git in a fun context. 
This text is main to understand the process of git and branches.

I have a main and a developer branch in the StockAPI project

When I update a file and want to update the my working branch (e.g. developer) then I write

git commit -m "commit text"
